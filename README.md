- Secure & continuous sync

## Bonus features
- Supports handy subset of markdown
- Easily filter with keywords and use quotes for "exact matches"
- Stays fast & responsive even for huge notes (tested on full text of War and Peace)
- Client side encryption means even the site owner can't see your notes (p.s., don't forget your password!)
- Its a progressive web app, so you can pin to your home screen and get an app-like experience (improved load times, full screen)
- Fully free & open source

## Bignote Cheat sheet
- `# Hash with space` at the beginning of a line makes a header
- `## Double Hash` with a space at the beginning of a line makes a subheader
- `- dash with space` at beginning of line makes a list
- `**asterisks**` make bold
- `_underscores_` make italics
- `` `backticks` `` make a code  block
- `// double slash with a space` makes an bookmark. Bookmarks show up in the search tab when there's no search term.
- `[ ] brackets with a space`  at the beginning of a line make a checkbox (you can search for them later using #todo)
- Urls like https://bignote.app become clickable after the first space
- Use @mentions  and #hashtags to make sure you can easily find notes about your  teammates or important themes   

## Other good things to know
- Filters include any lines that match, as well as any lines in the header or subheader the line is a part of (spaces reset it)
- Filtered views are fully editable. If you make a new line, it'll be directly below the previous line in the unfiltered view. It might not show up in the same filter if you search again (if it doesn't match).
